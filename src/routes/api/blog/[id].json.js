        body: `In dystopian London, a young woman named Sonnie participates in underground "Beastie" fights — remotely controlled bio-engineered gladiator beast battles. The ringmaster, Dicko, attempts to bribe Sonnie to throw the match, but she declines. Her teammates Wes and Ivrina explain that Sonnie was sexually assaulted and mutilated in the past; her desire for revenge eventually becomes her "edge". Sonnie enters the arena piloting her beast Khanivore, to fight the opponent, Turboraptor. After a brutal match, Khanivore wins. Later, Dicko's mistress visits Sonnie and seduces her, only to impale Sonnie's head with a concealed weapon. Dicko then reveals himself and taunts Sonnie, asking if she is scared now. The mistress then stomps at Sonnie's head, crushing it. However, Sonnie's laughter is heard, revealing that her human body is only a 'bioware processor spliced to a spine' and that her consciousness was always inside Khanivore, the fear of death in combat being her real "edge". Sonnie as Khanivore breaks out of her holding tank and kills the mistress, then prepares to kill Dicko. The screen fades to black as she asks: "Are you scared now?" mirroring Dicko's question.`,

        snippet: "The Blue Goose spaceship's crew members, Thom, Suzy, and Ray, are returning home from a successful mission, but an error in the routing plot causes unexpected events to happen. Thom awakes from suspended animation and is greeted by Greta, an old flame. She tells him that he and his crew are hundreds of thousands of light-years from Earth, nearly beyond the Aquila Rift, and centuries have passed: there is no way for them to get home. ",
        body: `The Blue Goose spaceship's crew members, Thom, Suzy, and Ray, are returning home from a successful mission, but an error in the routing plot causes unexpected events to happen. Thom awakes from suspended animation and is greeted by Greta, an old flame. She tells him that he and his crew are hundreds of thousands of light-years from Earth, nearly beyond the Aquila Rift, and centuries have passed: there is no way for them to get home. They rekindle their relationship, but Thom is still in disbelief of the situation. He demands the truth from a tearful Greta, who tells him that his experiences are a simulation and that he is not ready to see reality, as she truly does care for him and all those who find their way there. He insists, so she reluctantly relents and awakens him. Thom is revealed to be an emaciated old man; their ship caught in an enormous web with countless others; his crew either dead or trapped in their own trances; and "Greta" an alien arachnid creature. As a horrified Thom loses his mind from the encounter, "Greta" returns him to the dream world, minus his recent memories, just as she had with his crew and the others. She reawakens him and greets him all over again, a process that presumably repeats until Thom eventually dies.`,

As they plant explosives on the back car, Sui drops one of his when swerving to avoid a desert rat, alerting the guards. Kali opens cover fire as Hawk moves in to deal with the turrets.

Using the distraction, Sui knocks it off the convoy, but it shifts into vehicle mode and gives chase, crushing Kali as it does. Sui sacrifices himself to destroy the defense bot's CPU and the convoy. Rookie survives and takes the targeted microchip, lamenting the loss of his team. He is greeted by Bob, the team's coordinator, who congratulates him and tells him that he copied all of their brains before the mission. The crew greets Rookie in hologram form, commending him for a job well done.",

Snow barely survives the altercation after a woman named Hirald saves him. Snow thanks her and leaves. At night, Hirald visits Snow's camp to express her intention to travel with him. She then reveals that she is an agent sent by Earth Central Intelligence and requests Snow to come willingly so that they might study his physiology for the greater good. Hirald soon learns that Snow's wife committed suicide more than a century ago due to him not aging; the two then make love. Baris' goons ambush Snow's hideout, but Snow finishes them off with Hirald's help. Baris then shoots and seemingly kills Hirald; however, she recovers and kills him. The damaged Hirald then reveals herself to be a cyborg. Following a past accident, her surviving human brain and nervous system were fused with an artificial body, rendering her virtually immortal like Snow. The two bond over their loneliness and desire to find love within their immortality.",

There, Liang meets Tsiao-Jung's daughter, Yan, who tries to explain the plight of the Huli jing. Tsiao-Jung urges Yan to escape, but Liang's father kills Tsiao-Jung in front of them. Unbeknownst to his father, Liang lets Yan go. Years later, Liang's father dies just before the British colonizing of Hong Kong. Liang moves to Hong Kong where he works as a train engineer, and one night encounters Yan, now permanently human because industrialization has supplanted magic. Liang develops robotics engineering, and Yan comes to him for help. The Governor of Hong Kong had drugged her and turned her into a cyborg sex toy, but she eventually killed him after an altercation. Liang builds her a flexible metal alloy body able to morph into a robotic Huli jing. Parting as friends, Yan then hunts Englishmen abusing women in her homeland.",
